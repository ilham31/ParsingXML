The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.

Security Fix(es) :

* A race condition was found in systemd. This could result in automount requests not being serviced and processes using them could hang, causing denial of service. (CVE-2018-1049)",Update the affected packages.,3,2018-07-25T16:11:10.749Z,,open

Nautilus is the file manager and graphical shell for the GNOME desktop.

Security Fix(es) :

* An untrusted .desktop file with executable permission set could choose its displayed name and icon, and execute commands without warning when opened by the user. An attacker could use this flaw to trick a user into opening a .desktop file disguised as a document, such as a PDF, and execute arbitrary commands. (CVE-2017-14604)

Note: This update will change the behavior of Nautilus. Nautilus will now prompt the user for confirmation when executing an untrusted .desktop file for the first time, and then add it to the trusted file list.

The dhcp packages provide a relay agent and ISC DHCP service required to enable and administer DHCP on a network.

Security Fix(es) :

* It was found that the DHCP daemon did not properly clean up closed OMAPI connections in certain cases.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es) :

An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited.

Note: This issue is present in hardware and cannot be fully fixed via software update. The updated kernel packages provide software mitigation for this hardware issue at a cost of potential performance penalty. Please refer to References section for further information about this issue and the performance impact.

In this update initial mitigations for IBM Power (PowerPC) and IBM zSeries (S390) architectures are provided.

* Variant CVE-2017-5715 triggers the speculative execution by utilizing branch target injection. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall and guest/host boundaries and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. This fix specifically addresses S390 processors. (CVE-2017-5715, Important)

* Variant CVE-2017-5753 triggers the speculative execution by performing a bounds-check bypass. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall boundary and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. This fix specifically addresses S390 and PowerPC processors. (CVE-2017-5753, Important)

* Variant CVE-2017-5754 relies on the fact that, on impacted microprocessors, during speculative execution of instruction permission faults, exception generation triggered by a faulting access is suppressed until the retirement of the whole instruction block. In a combination with the fact that memory accesses may populate the cache even when the block is being dropped and never committed (executed), an unprivileged local attacker could use this flaw to read privileged (kernel space) memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. Note: CVE-2017-5754 affects Intel x86-64 microprocessors. AMD x86-64 microprocessors are not affected by this issue. This fix specifically addresses PowerPC processors.

The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

Security Fix(es) :

* A use-after-free flaw leading to denial of service was found in the way BIND internally handled cleanup operations on upstream recursion fetch contexts. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to make named, acting as a DNSSEC validating resolver, exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure via a specially crafted DNS request.

The java-1.8.0-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 8 Java Runtime Environment and the OpenJDK 8 Java Software Development Kit.

Security Fix(es) :

* Multiple flaws were found in the Hotspot and AWT components of OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2018-2582, CVE-2018-2641)

* It was discovered that the LDAPCertStore class in the JNDI component of OpenJDK failed to securely handle LDAP referrals. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to make it fetch attacker controlled certificate data. (CVE-2018-2633)

* The JGSS component of OpenJDK ignores the value of the javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly property when using HTTP/SPNEGO authentication and always uses global credentials. It was discovered that this could cause global credentials to be unexpectedly used by an untrusted Java application. (CVE-2018-2634)

* It was discovered that the JMX component of OpenJDK failed to properly set the deserialization filter for the SingleEntryRegistry in certain cases. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to bypass intended deserialization restrictions. (CVE-2018-2637)

* It was discovered that the LDAP component of OpenJDK failed to properly encode special characters in user names when adding them to an LDAP search query. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to manipulate LDAP queries performed by the LdapLoginModule class.
(CVE-2018-2588)

* It was discovered that the DNS client implementation in the JNDI component of OpenJDK did not use random source ports when sending out DNS queries. This could make it easier for a remote attacker to spoof responses to those queries. (CVE-2018-2599)

* It was discovered that the I18n component of OpenJDK could use an untrusted search path when loading resource bundle classes. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code as another local user by making their Java application load an attacker controlled class file. (CVE-2018-2602)

* It was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK failed to sufficiently limit the amount of memory allocated when reading DER encoded input. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make a Java application use an excessive amount of memory if it parsed attacker supplied DER encoded input. (CVE-2018-2603)

* It was discovered that the key agreement implementations in the JCE component of OpenJDK did not guarantee sufficient strength of used keys to adequately protect generated shared secret. This could make it easier to break data encryption by attacking key agreement rather than the encryption using the negotiated secret. (CVE-2018-2618)

* It was discovered that the JGSS component of OpenJDK failed to properly handle GSS context in the native GSS library wrapper in certain cases. A remote attacker could possibly make a Java application using JGSS to use a previously freed context.
(CVE-2018-2629)

* It was discovered that multiple classes in the Libraries, AWT, and JNDI components of OpenJDK did not sufficiently validate input when creating object instances from the serialized form. A specially crafted input could cause a Java application to create objects with an inconsistent state or use an excessive amount of memory when deserialized. (CVE-2018-2663, CVE-2018-2677, CVE-2018-2678)

* It was discovered that multiple encryption key classes in the Libraries component of OpenJDK did not properly synchronize access to their internal data. This could possibly cause a multi-threaded Java application to apply weak encryption to data because of the use of a key that was zeroed out. (CVE-2018-2579)
